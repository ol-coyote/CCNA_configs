	These are online backups of my configuration files that I use on the Cisco series routers. These files contain the configurations for RIP and OSPF routing protocols. These are compatible with Cisco 2800 series routers that are currently running IOS v12. The switches in this lab are two 2960 Catalyst switches and a a single 3550 switch that supports layer 3 switching and POE. 

Further implimentation will integrate two VOIP telephones, a Cisco ASA5505 Adaptive security device, and I plan on purchasing a Cisco 3560 switch or two if the budget allows for a CCNP in the future.
